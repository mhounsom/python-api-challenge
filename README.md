This assignment is broken down into two separate parts where we create a Python script visualize weather of 500+ cities across the world and also using Jupyter-Gmaps and Google Places API to visualize a map for where to take the ideal vacation at. The first part we create scatter plots and create/calculate linear regression from city weather information that was retreived via an API call.
